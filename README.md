### [DropOff mod](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/dropoff) for Minecraft.
***
Mod, in functionality similar to the DropOff button from the [Quark](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/quark), but with hot key and flexible configuration for any needs.<br />
<br />

You can click the button in the inventory or press '**X**' (by default), and the contents of the player inventory will be moved to the nearest chests, furnaces and containers from other modifications (see mod config to change any property).<br />
Also, the contents of these containers and player inventory will be sorted (sorting can be disabled).<br />
<br />

**WARNING:** In versions for Minecraft 1.10.2 and higher this mod replaces similar functionality from Quark when you press Quark's own button.<br />
If you do not want it to happen, set "Override Quark button" to "false" in config.<br />
